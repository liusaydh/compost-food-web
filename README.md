# compost-food-web
Mushroom compost food web modelling in R, supplemented by nematode analysis.

This is the most basic extant model for an "artificial" mushroom compost model. Artificial, due to the fact that it is a food web not commonly found in nature, but rather an achievement of dozens and hundreds of years of selective breeding and composting to achieve perfect conditions in wbich to raise _Agaricus bisporus_ to a commercially viable extent. 

As an artificial environment, specifically created to maximally propagate a single living organism, this food web is likewise truncated in comparison to any natural counterpart. The microbiota (pre-extant bacteria and fungi) are altered through processes of casing and aerating, changing the humidity and temperature and affecting entire generations and types of microbial fauna present. Likewise, some larger critters are not present (centipedes, mites and beetles of all kinds), as well as snails.
